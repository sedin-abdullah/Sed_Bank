# API reference

`79` endpoints. Base URL is the API origin — `http://localhost:5001` locally,
`https://sedbank-api.onrender.com` deployed.

Every response uses the same envelope:

```json
{ "success": true,  "data": { } }
{ "success": false, "error": { "message": "…", "fields": { } } }
```

Authentication is a bearer token from `POST /api/auth/login`:

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

**Access column** — `Public` needs no token. `Signed in` needs any valid token and
then scopes to what the caller owns (a borrower only ever sees their own records).
Named roles are enforced server-side; `Admin` passes every staff check.

*Generated from `backend/src/routes/index.js`, which is the single place the whole
access model is declared.*

## Notes

- **PDFs** — `/schedule.pdf`, `/statement.pdf` and `/noc.pdf` return
  `application/pdf`, generated with `pdf-lib`. The NOC only exists once a loan is
  closed or foreclosed.
- **Uploads** — `POST /api/applications/:id/documents` is `multipart/form-data`
  with fields `type` and `file`. JPG, PNG or PDF, 5 MB max.
- **Mocked integrations** — `/api/mock/*` are the KYC, bureau, penny-drop and
  payment-gateway stand-ins. No external service is ever called.
- **Test hooks** — `/api/testing/*` (loan back-dating, data reset, delinquency
  sweep) return `404` unless `ENABLE_TEST_HOOKS=true`. They are disabled in
  production, which also makes the bureau `simulate` parameter inert.
- **Realtime** — Socket.IO on the same origin, authenticated with the same
  bearer token. Rooms are per-user and per-role, which is how an officer's
  worklist updates without a refresh.
