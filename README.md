# SedBank

A digital lending platform covering the whole personal-loan lifecycle —
application, KYC, credit bureau check, underwriting, offer, e-signature,
disbursement, EMI repayment, collections and closure — for both the borrower
and the operations team.

Built for Sedin Technologies as a demonstration platform. Every external
integration is simulated; no real financial or personal data is processed.

## Documentation

| | |
|---|---|
| [docs/FLOW.md](docs/FLOW.md) | The end-to-end journey, step by step, with the underwriting rules |
| [docs/CREDENTIALS.md](docs/CREDENTIALS.md) | The five demo logins and what each role can do |
| [docs/API.md](docs/API.md) | All 79 endpoints with their access rules |
| [docs/TECH_STACK.md](docs/TECH_STACK.md) | Architecture, libraries, testing, deployment |

## Run it locally

```bash
npm run install:all
npm run dev
```

- API → <http://localhost:5001>
- Web → <http://localhost:5173>

No database setup is needed. With `MONGO_URI` empty the API boots an in-process
MongoDB and seeds the five demo login accounts, so you can sign in straight
away. Sign in as `admin@sedbank.test` / `Admin@12345`.

Business data is deliberately **not** seeded — a fresh install reads zero and
every screen shows a real empty state. [docs/FLOW.md](docs/FLOW.md) walks a loan
through end to end, which is the quickest way to see the whole product.

## Tests

```bash
npm run test:unit    # 46 Jest tests — EMI maths, underwriting rules
npm run test:api     # 303 assertions over 98 requests (Newman)
npm run test:e2e     # 87 Playwright tests across desktop, tablet and phone
npm test             # all three
```

Both integration suites boot their own throwaway API, so nothing needs to be
running first. For the e2e suite, install browsers once with
`npm run playwright:install`.

## What is in the box

**Two portals from one shell.** Borrowers get `/app`; credit, ops, collections
and admin staff get `/admin`, with navigation filtered per role and the same
rules enforced server-side.

**A real rule engine.** Bureau score, income floor and FOIR decide between
straight-through approval, an officer's queue, and rejection — then price the
offer off the score band. Thresholds are editable at runtime.

**Live updates.** Socket.IO pushes application and loan changes, so an
officer's worklist and a borrower's status change without a refresh.

**Generated documents.** EMI schedules, account statements and No-Dues
Certificates are produced as real PDFs.

**An audit trail.** Every decision, verification and configuration change is
recorded with actor and timestamp.

## Deployment

The API runs on Render, the SPA on Vercel, the database on MongoDB Atlas.
`render.yaml` and `frontend/vercel.json` carry the configuration that matters;
[docs/TECH_STACK.md](docs/TECH_STACK.md) covers the rest.

Four environment variables decide whether a deployment works at all:

| Variable | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| `MONGO_URI` | Empty means an in-memory database that is wiped on restart |
| `JWT_SECRET` | The app refuses to boot in production with the bundled default |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | Must list the web origin exactly, or the browser is blocked |
| `SEED_ON_BOOT` | With a real database the seeder is skipped, leaving no accounts to sign in with |

Two flags keep a deployment demo-only: `EXPOSE_OTP=true` returns the mocked OTP
to any caller (the e-sign step cannot complete without it, as no SMS vendor is
wired up), and the seeded accounts use published passwords. Do not put real
data behind either.
